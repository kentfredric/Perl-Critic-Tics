version 0.004

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.004';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl-Critic-Tics distribution includes extra policies for Perl::Critic to
address a fairly random assortment of things that make me (rjbs) wince.

=head1 WHY TICS?

Take your pick:

=over

=item B<T>hings B<I> B<C>an't B<S>tand

=item They set off my nervous tic.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Perl::Critic>, the driving force behind it all.  L<Perl::Critic::Lax>, the
other half of things I don't like: things I don't like about core Perl::Critic
rules.

Other people have released their own tics:

=over

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Bangs>

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Swift>
